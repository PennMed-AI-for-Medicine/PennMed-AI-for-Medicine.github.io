  <strong>Welcome to MPHY 6120: Artificial Intelligence for Medicine!</strong> This course is taught by Dr. Rafe McBeth, a medical physicist at the University of Pennsylvania. Throughout the semester, you will learn to:
  <ul>
    <li>Interact with diverse medical data (images, clinical text, structured clinical data)</li>
    <li>Process and analyze these data for machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models</li>
    <li>Apply fundamental ML/DL methods to tackle Radiology and Radiation Oncology tasks</li>
    <li>Incorporate advanced techniques, including large language models (LLMs) and reinforcement learning (RL), into clinical workflows</li>
  </ul>

The overarching goal is to equip students with practical programming and AI skills so they can meaningfully contribute to future clinical applications in medical physics and beyond.

We encourage in-person attendance to foster a collaborative learning environment during lab sessions. Students who cannot attend a specific day should contact the instructor to discuss possible alternatives.

**Course Description:**
The fields of data science (DS) and artificial intelligence (AI) are transforming medicine and will continue to shape the future of Medical Physics. This course helps graduate students develop the expertise to integrate DS and AI into clinical research and practice. Through hands-on exercises, projects, and lectures, we cover:
- Practical Python programming for data analysis
- Key machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) approaches (e.g., CNNs, Transformers)
- Large language models (LLMs) for clinical NLP
- Reinforcement learning (RL) basics for medical decision-making
- Ethical, regulatory, and translational aspects of AI in medicine

**Course Format:**
We meet twice a week for 90-minute sessions. 
- **Lectures** (first ~45–60 minutes) will introduce theoretical concepts, review relevant medical AI studies, and outline best practices.
- **Lab/Practical Time** (remaining ~30–45 minutes) will be spent working through Python notebooks, coding exercises, and project development.

**Required Course Resources:**
No primary textbook is required. All slides, Jupyter notebooks, and example code will be provided through:
- **Course GitHub Repository:** [https://github.com/PennMed-AI-for-Medicine](https://github.com/PennMed-AI-for-Medicine)
- **Course Website:** [https://pennmed-ai-for-medicine.github.io/](https://pennmed-ai-for-medicine.github.io/)

**Optional Course Resources:**
- *Machine and Deep Learning in Oncology, Medical Physics and Radiology* (2nd ed.) by Issam El Naqa et al., 2022, ISBN 978-3-030-83046-5
- *How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python (2nd ed.)* by Elkner, Downey, & Meyers [Free: https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/]
- *Python for Data Analysis* (3rd ed.) by Wes McKinney (ISBN-10: 109810403X)
- *The AI Revolution in Medicine: GPT-4 and Beyond* by Peter Lee, Carey Goldberg, and Isaac Kohane (ISBN-10: 0138200130)

**Grading:**
- **50% Homework Assignments** – Short coding and data analysis tasks to reinforce weekly concepts  
- **20% Midterm Project** – Structured data ML project (or a small-scale imaging/NLP project)  
- **20% Final Project** – Comprehensive DL/NLP/RL project on a more complex medical dataset  
- **10% Attendance & Participation** – Engaging in in-class discussions, presentations, and peer feedback
