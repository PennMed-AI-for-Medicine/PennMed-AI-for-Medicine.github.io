  title: Course Introduction & The Field Guide Mindset
  description: >
    We introduce the course philosophy: you will learn to build AI tools for medicine,
    evaluate them with discipline, and write the field guide someone else could use.
    Key concepts include Models vs Systems, Metrics vs Readiness, and the governance mindset.
